        <h1>THE PASION OF THE JEWELLER</h1>
        <small>By Litus Fixe</small>
        <p>
          Hello, I'm Sui, jeweler and founder of The Sui
          Studio in Girona. I was born in Hong Kong, where
          art found me as a child, and later I studied Fine
          Arts before embarking on a journey that took me to
          Bergen, Norway. There, I worked alongside a master
          jeweler, descendant of a great sculptural
          tradition, and discovered that silver could be my
          canvas.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each of my pieces is born from an intimate,
          artisanal process. I work only with silver—a metal
          I shape with patience and respect, without haste
          or mass production. I began selling at markets, my
          hands marked by effort and craft, until my
          workshop became the soul of The Sui Studio. Pure
          lines, textures, and volumes that speak for
          themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          My creations reflect my life: woven from journeys,
          lessons, and silences transformed into forms. I
          don’t seek the spectacular, but the authentic;
          pieces that endure over time and adapt to those
          who wear them. What defines me is my devotion to
          craftsmanship, made with hands and heart.
        </p>

          Today, my little space in the heart of Girona is
          both my refuge and my window to the world. Here,
          among tools, sketches, and the ever-surprising
          silver, I continue to create. If you’re nearby, I
          invite you in—even if just to share tea and tell
          me your story. Because in the end, every jewel is
          a dialogue: between my roots, my hands, and yours.
